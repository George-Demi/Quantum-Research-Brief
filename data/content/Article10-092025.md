### Understanding Quantum RAM Series: Part 1
In this series we discuss theoretical and experimental suggestions which have
advanced the development of quantum RAMs (qRAM). We try to do this in a
chronological way.

Before discussing qRAM, we should first ask ourselves: What is classical
RAM? RAM which stands for random access memory, allows us to store infor-
mation temporarily on our computers. Unlike persistent memory, RAM does
not store information when the power is off. You can think of it as an array of
memory cells and we can address these cells independently, this is why it’s called
“random”, it’s not in the sense that the value of the stored information is un-
certain, or that we cannot address a certain memory cell with 100% confidence,
it means that you can choose to write in or read from whichever memory slot
you like. Imagine a playlist of 10 songs, “random” access means that you can
immediately listen to the song that you desire. A playlist where in order to play
the 5th song, you must go through songs 1,2,3 and 4 would not be characterized
as random access.




To give some motivation on how digital information is stored, let us consider
figure 1.

1.

As we can see, it is a simple OR gate whose output is passed back as an input.
Consider the situation where we start with the inputs 0 at both lines x and y,
then at the output line z we will have 0 and as it gets looped back to the front
of the circuit, the value at y will not change from 0. Now consider we pass an
input 1 at x. The output at z will be of value 1 and as it gets looped back, it
will change the value at y to 1. Now if we decide to pass 0 at x, the value of 1
at z will not change. Therefore, once a value of 1 is passed for input x, there’s
no going back, the information is STORED, the output of this circuit (the bit
that runs through line z) will always be 1, whether you input at x a value of 0 or
1 in the next step, it will not change the output bit that runs through z whose
value is 1! This represents a circuit which can store the bit of value 1. Another
similar circuit can be built from the AND gate to store the bit of value 0 as
shown in figure 2, you can convince yourself this serves the intended function.

In order to properly store information, we need to construct circuits which can
store both 0s and 1s and not just 0s or 1s exclusively. Also, we need to be able
to modify the information stored in the circuit.

Combining these two circuits mentioned above one can construct a circuit
called a “Gated Latch” gate which has for input the data which we want to store
and a special bit which is called the “write enable” bit which controls whether
data can be written into the circuit or not, it indicates if the circuit is open for
business or not. The output is the data that is stored in the circuit (just as for
the previous circuits). These “Gated Latch” circuits can be considered as the
memory cells. Bunching these memory cells into arrays, we get registers.

Once we have an array of these memory cells, we need one last ingredient
to build our RAM. As mentioned, we need to be able to address whichever cell
we want for our memory to be considered a RAM. A “Multiplexer” allows us to
write at a specific cell provided we pass into it the address of said cell. So what
we actually need to do to write in the RAM is pass the data which is going to
be written into memory along with the address where we want to write it and
the multiplexer will enable writing for the cell where we want our information
to be stored.

We did not go into the details of how the Gated Latch and Multiplexer cir-
cuits are constructed since this article is meant to convey the general idea of
RAM. In the upcoming parts of this series, we will discuss how RAM can work
when we are working with quantum information instead of classical.
