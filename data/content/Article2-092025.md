## Introduction  

 &nbsp; &nbsp;Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are exotic quasiparticles in topological super
conductors that exhibit non-Abelian statistics. Their appeal for quantum com
puting lies in inherent robustness: information encoded in such modes resists
 local perturbations, offering fault tolerance through topological protection.
 When one braids Majorana zero modes adiabatically around each other, the
 result is a unitary operation. Your first reaction might be a sense of awe, I
 know mine was: Braiding quasi-particles allowing us to perform quantum gates.
 I think the non-intuitive nature of this scheme of quantum computation which
 amazes us is what makes it fault tolerant: the fact that it is a global transfor
mation on the system which at the end returns it to the original configuration
 since the MZMs are identical. Although this scheme sounds very attractive, it
 faces a couple of challenges such as slow operation times and adiabatic errors
 coming from the fact that the operation is being performed at a finite speed.
 In a recent paper by Zhu-yao Jin and Jun Jin at Zhejiang University (Jin &
 Jing, 2025) titled “Universal quantum control over Majorana zero modes”, the
 authors consider a system of three MZMs and construct braiding operations
 among them in an ingenious way which addresses many issues.

## Core Contribution  

 &nbsp; &nbsp;Jin and Jing develop their strategy by using the framework of universal
 quantum control (UQC). In quantum information theory, UQC refers to the
 ability to perform any desired unitary transformation on a quantum system
 through a set of basic controllable interactions. In the context of Majorana zero
 modes, this framework allows the design of braiding protocols that are not only
 mathematically universal but also physically realizable. With a clever twist,
 Jin and Jing use a lattice defect (LD) as a mediator to enable indirect,
 tunable exchange interactions among the MZMs. These interactions are
 activated via largely detuned driving fields applied to the mediator.

## Mechanism and Dynamics  

&nbsp; &nbsp; Under strong detuning of these driving fields, the system’s dynamics simplify
into an effective two-body interaction Hamiltonian between any two MZMs.
This Hamiltonian allows for nonadiabatic evolution passages that enact
the desired braiding operations. Importantly, the researchers incorporate rapid
modulation of a global phase along these passages, which significantly enhances
robustness against drive-field errors

## Chiral Population Transfer  

 &nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond simple braiding, the protocol also supports chiral population
 transfer along universal passages. This transfer can occur clockwise or coun
terclockwise among the three MZMs, demonstrating both directionality and
 precision.

## Error Suppression via Global Phase Modulation  

 &nbsp; &nbsp;Systematic errors in the driving fields—such as frequency deviations or Rabi
frequency mismatches—pose risks to fidelity. The protocol counters this by
 modulating the global phase, effectively suppressing transitions that would
 otherwise degrade performance. Simulations suggest high fidelities.
