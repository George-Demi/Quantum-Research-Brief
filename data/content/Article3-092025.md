### Motivation: Two-Qubit Gates with Rydberg Atoms

Two qubit gates are crucial to achieve universal quantum computation. In
any of the qc physical platforms, to construct such two qubit gates, one needs
to utilize interactions. For neutral atoms, one such interaction arises when two
atoms are put into a highly excited Rydberg state, they can interact via dipole-
dipole or van der Waals forces. This interaction allows for the construction of
two qubit gates via the phenomenon called the Rydberg blockade
<br><br>

### Blockade and Anti-Blockade

The Rydberg blockade is when the interaction between two neutral atoms
prohibits their simultaneous excitation. In the same vein, physicists can also
achieve a phenomenon called the Rydberg anti-blockade which is when two
atoms are excited to Rydberg states even though they are in proximity to each
other and are interacting via a Rydberg interaction. This can happen because
we can tune the laser such that the interaction-induced energy shift of the sec-
ond atom due to the presence of the first atom is compensated. To realize this
phenomenon, one needs to set the laser detuning ∆ between the level of concern
and the Rydberg level to half the Rydberg interaction strength V . This is a
way to simultaneously excite two atoms thus it can be used for the construction
of two qubit gates.

### Challenges of Rydberg Anti-Blockade

However, realizing a Rydberg anti-blockade comes with many challenges as
mentioned in Wu et al., 2025:
1. Narrow resonance condition 2∆ = V which might be broken due to a
variation in the interatomic distance or the laser detuning.
2. The achieved doubly excited state decays quickly due to spontaneous emis-
sion.
3. In order to determine which pairs undergo Rydberg anti-blockade, one
needs to use individual addressing.

### Floquet Frequency Modulation: The Solution

In a recent paper by J. Wu et. al (Wu et al., 2025), they overcome these
challenges by using Floquet frequency modulation techniques to realize Rydberg
anti-blockade irrespective of the Rydberg interaction strength. Their scheme
provides a way to stabilize the doubly-excited states no matter the interatomic
distance and allows to perform two qubit gates without the need for individual
addressing.

### Two-Atom Setup and Floquet Analysis
A two-atom version of the scheme consists of two neutral atoms which have
two hyperfine levels |0⟩ and |1⟩ which encode the qubit and a Rydberg state
|r⟩, as shown in figure 2. The levels |1⟩ and |r⟩ are coupled via a laser, how-
ever, unlike previous Rydberg schemes the detuning ∆(t) here is time depen-
dent and depends on what frequency and amplitude the system is driven with.
Through a Floquet analysis, the effective Rabi coupling becomes weighted by
Bessel functions of the modulation index, which can be tuned to enhance or
suppress specific transitions. This provides analytic control over gate dynamics
and enables the realization of single-step controlled-phase (C-Phase) gates.

### Soft Quantum Control
To further improve gate fidelity, the authors incorporate a soft quantum
control technique: instead of driving with a square pulse, they shape the Rabi
frequency with a Gaussian profile. This suppresses fast oscillations, reduces
sensitivity to errors in the rotating-wave approximation, and results in more
robust gate operations.

### Demonstration: Grover–Long Algorithm
Finally, as a demonstration of the power of their method, they implement the
Grover–Long algorithm using the Floquet-tailored C-Phase gate. The scheme
supports arbitrary controlled phases, which are required in Grover–Long search.
With this, they achieve zero failure probability in their simulations, highlight-
ing the promise of Floquet-tailored Rydberg interactions for scalable quantum
computation.
