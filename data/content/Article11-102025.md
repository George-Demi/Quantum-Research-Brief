### Understanding Quantum RAM Series: Part 2
&nbsp;In the previous episode of this series, we introduced classical RAM as being an
array of memory slots which you can randomly access, either to read from or to
write in. In this episode, we make a basic introduction on how such a memory
can be constructed for quantum information.
While classical information comes in the form of bits which can take on a
value of 0 or 1, quantum information usually comes in the form of qubits which
can be superpositions of 0 or 1. We assume that the reader is already familiar
with the basics of quantum information and how it can be modified using quan-
tum gates.

&nbsp;The idea that superpositions are possible means that not only the stored
data can be in a superposition but also the address in a sense that we can ac-
cess a superposition of memory cells. To describe the operation of RAMs, we
usually use binary decision trees such as in figure 1:

Imagine a building where each apartment is connected to its neighbor upstairs

and to its two neighbors downstairs by staircases. The door at the entrance
of a staircase is marked by a label which reads either “0” or “1”. Consider a
person starting on the rooftop of this apartment building who wants to end up
in a specific storage room in the basement. In order to specify the address of
said room, he is given a string of 0s and 1s and his instructions are to follow
the sequence of doors denoted by that string. This is a simplified model of how
RAM works, the user has an address and some data which he wants to store in
the memory cell (the storage room in the basement) with that specific address.
How would a quantum version of this picture of RAM work? A first sugges-
tion would be to allow superposition at each node in our graph, i.e. having a
superposition of going through the door labeled 0 or the door labeled 1. This
naive approach however might lead to problems. In order to see this, consider
again a three level binary decision tree, however we now allow quantum superpo-
sition at each node. Let us begin with the state $|\psi ⟩ = 12 (|00⟩ + |01⟩ + |10⟩ + |11⟩)$
being passed into the address register. A superposition will be created at each
node in our graph. It will also demonstrate a lot of entanglement. The number
of nodes is of the order $O(2n)$ where n is the number of levels we have on our
graph. Maintaining quantum coherence on so many quantum systems is im-
practical.

&nbsp;To fix this issue, Giovannetti suggested what is called the “bucket-brigade”
protocol (Giovannetti et al., 2008). The way this protocol fixes the issue of
maintaining coherence on exponentially many quantum systems is by making
each node a qutrit: a three level quantum system. The possible states of the
qutrits are $|lef t⟩$, $|right⟩$ and $|wait⟩$. Initially, all the qutrits are initialized in
the $|wait⟩$ state. Then qubits of the address register are sent which pave the
path for the data to be stored through our graph. The qubit-qutrit encounter is
described by a unitary transformation which sets the qutrit to the state $|lef t⟩$
when the qubit is in the state $|0⟩$ and the state $|right⟩$ when the qubit is in
the state $|1⟩$. Once the path is paved, we can send in the data which we want
to store in our memory cells. The reason that the “bucket-brigade” protocol is
better than the naive approach described above is that in each branch of the
superposition, there are only $log(2n)$ qutrits which are active (meaning they are
either in the $|lef t⟩$ or the $|right⟩$ state).

In this part of the series:

1 . We showed the difference between classical and quantum RAM.

2 . We discussed Giovannetti’s “bucket-brigade” protocol (Giovannetti et al.,2008) which is a practical proposal for the development of a quantum RAM.

Stay tuned as we learn more about qRAM together.
