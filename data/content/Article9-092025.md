Imagine trying to simulate a system of n qubits on a classical computer, since this system lives in a Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$, the memory required to store the amplitudes grows exponentially. However, there are certain types of states and operations which can be simulated easily on classical computers: stabilizer states and Clifford operations. Stabilizer states are states can be described as the unique simultaneous +1 eigenstate of a set of commuting tensor products of Pauli operators. These states are nice since their identity can be determined by determining their stabilizers. Clifford gates are a special set of operations which leave the Pauli operators invariant under conjugation. The Gottesman-Knill theorem states that quantum computation that begins with a stabilizer state, applies only Clifford gates, and measures only Pauli operators can be simulated on a classical computer in polynomial time.

## Quantum magic

In order to truly speak of quantum advantage one needs to see how different a certain state is from the above mentioned stabilizer states since the latter cannot be easily simulated on classical computers. This is called "Quantum Magic" (physicists have never been the most creative at naming new properties). It can be quantified using the rank α stabilizer Rényi entropy which for a pure state |ψ⟩ of L qubits is given by:

$$M_α(|ψ⟩) = \frac{1}{1 - α} \log_2 \left( \frac{1}{2^L} \sum_P | \langle ψ| P |ψ⟩ |^{2α} \right) \qquad (1)$$

where $P$ is all possible tensor products of length $L$ of the Pauli operators.

## Topological order and complexity

In a recent paper by A. G. Catalano et. al. titled "Quantum complexity of topological phases. Or lack thereof" (Catalano et al., 2025), the authors investigate whether complexity (which in this context refers to how difficult it is to simulate a certain quantum system) and topological order are somehow related by calculating the stabilizer Rényi entropy (eq. 1) of 1D symmetry protected topological phases.

What are topological phases? And why would the authors think that they would somehow be related to quantum magic? Topological phases of matter allow us to utilize global transformations for robust quantum information processing. This can for example happen in the Kitaev model, whose edges act as anyons which can be used to construct a qubit. In this case, unitary operations would not consist of simply local manipulations of the anyons, rather, they would be realized by braiding the anyons around each other. The global nature of the braiding operation makes the process fault tolerant, insensitive to local perturbations. These systems can pave the way to non-trivial methods of quantum computation. They are special in the sense that they can possess symmetry protected edge states and present exotic correlations not seen in different quantum systems. Therefore, it makes sense to ask whether topological order is somehow related to quantum magic.

## The dimerized XX model

The authors start by calculating the stabilizer Rényi entropy for the dimerized XX model with Open Boundary Conditions. Since we have promised to keep these articles brief, we will not go into the details of the model, just note that the model is characterized by a certain parameter δ which controls the dimerization thus controlling whether or not the system is in a topologically non-trivial phase:

&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;  $−1 ≤ δ < 0 →$ topologically trivial phase

&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;   $0 < δ ≤ 1 →$ topologically non-trivial phase

## Results and Conclusions

The authors' creative strategy to investigate the relation between topological order and complexity is to plot the stabilizer Rényi entropy of the ground state against the δ parameter of the dimerized XX model. Their results are shown in figure 2:

The results show that the maximum, or as I would like to call it: the "most magical", is in the topologically non-trivial regime and the peak approaches the critical point $δ = 0$ as L increases. Instead of declaring victory and claiming that there is an obvious relation between topological order and quantum magic, the authors did their due diligence and tried doing the same plot using Periodic Boundary Conditions instead of Open Boundary Conditions. They found that the asymmetry of the plot, i.e. the peak being shifted into the non-trivial region, was not there anymore. They concluded that the shift was due to the breaking of the duality symmetry and that there was no relation between quantum magic and topological order. To be sure of the results, they also repeated the same investigations for the Cluster Ising and the transverse field Ising models (which does not host a topologically non-trivial phase).
