## Introduction  

 &nbsp;Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) operates by preparing a large entangled state, called a **cluster state**, and then carrying out the computation through sequential single-qubit measurements. This model avoids long gate sequences but relies critically on the ability to generate and preserve cluster states with high fidelity.  

 &nbsp;In a recent paper published on the arxiv titled “1D Cluster State Genera
tion on Superconducting Hardware” (Sharma & Islam, 2025), the authors
 discuss how superconducting charge qubits which are small superconducting
islands connected by Josephson junctions and allow strong coupling and con
trollable interactions, can be used to generate cluster states. They discuss how
 decoherence is a major obstacle, with two dominant noise channels:

- **Energy relaxation (T1):** qubits decay from excited to ground states.  
- **Dephasing (T2):** loss of relative phase coherence without energy loss.  

 &nbsp;This paper investigates how a 4-qubit 1D cluster state such as the one
 shown in figure 2 can be generated on a charge-qubit array and how decoherence
 affects fidelity.

## System and Methodology  

### Four-Qubit Setup  
 &nbsp; &nbsp;The system consists of four charge qubits arranged linearly. Each qubit is initialized in the superposition state |+⟩, and neighboring qubits interact via capacitive couplings, leading to a nearest-neighbor interacting Hamiltonian.  

Instead of applying discrete CZ gates, the authors let the system evolve naturally under this Hamiltonian. At specific times (odd multiples of π), the entanglement matches the structure of a 1D cluster state.

### Noise Modeling  
 &nbsp;The evolution is simulated with and without decoherence using **QuTiP** (Quantum Toolbox in Python) for solving the Lindblad master equations. Fidelity with respect to the ideal cluster state is computed as a function of time.  

 <br> <br>

## Results  

### Ideal Case  
 &nbsp;Without noise, fidelity revives perfectly to 100% at odd multiples of π. This
 confirms that charge-qubit arrays can, in principle, generate exact cluster states.

### With Energy Relaxation (T1)  
 &nbsp; When only T1 noise is included: 
 - The first revival still exceeds **90% fidelity**.
 - By the fourth revival, fidelity drops to ~**80%**.  
 Relaxation degrades fidelity gradually, allowing short-time cluster state generation with acceptable quality.  

### With Dephasing (T2)  
 &nbsp;When only T2 acts:
 - First revival remains above **90%**.  
 - Fidelity decays much faster, falling to ~**70%** by the fourth revival.  
 Dephasing therefore poses a more serious threat, as it directly disrupts the entanglement structure.  

### With Both T1 and T2  
 &nbsp;When both channels are active:
 - First revival drops to ~**85%**.  
 - Later revivals fall below **70%**.  
 This Confirms compounded effects, with fidelity degrading faster than under either channel alone.  

### Coherence After Projection  
 &nbsp;Coherence after projection decays more severely with T2: 
 - Under combined noise, coherence falls to ~**50%** within 15 time units.  
 - With only T1, it remains above **70%**.  

 <br> <br>



## Key Insights  

1. **Dephasing is more damaging than relaxation.** T2 noise rapidly destroys entanglement, making it the primary barrier to reliable cluster-state generation.  

2. **Short-time generation is feasible.**  The first revival consistently yields ~**85%** fidelity, suggesting usable cluster states can be generated before noise dominates.  

 <br> <br>

## Conclusion  

 &nbsp; &nbsp;Sharma and Islam provide a combined analytical and numerical study of 1D cluster-state generation on superconducting charge qubits.  

The study concludes that **dephasing (T2) is the key limitation** for superconducting MBQC and that cluster state generation is possible in **narrow time windows**. While small cluster states can be generated with usable fidelity in short times, scaling requires **dedicated noise mitigation strategies**.
