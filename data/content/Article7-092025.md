In our quest to enter a new quantum era, our main rival is dissipation.
However, one should remember the saying “Keep your friends close, and your
enemies closer” since dissipation can sometimes work out in our favor. In a
recent paper by T. Chen et. al. titled “Collective dissipation engineering of
interacting Rydberg atoms” (Chen et al., 2025) the authors take a fresh look
at the role of dissipation in quantum systems. While it is usually seen as a
destructive force that erodes coherence, they show how carefully engineered loss
can instead be used as a powerful tool for control and state preparation in arrays
of Rydberg atoms.

The team demonstrates a way to build a tunable, laser-induced loss channel
that selectively targets Rydberg states. This channel works both when atoms
are isolated and when they strongly interact, giving the researchers precise control over dissipation in settings that were previously dominated by coherent
dynamics alone. By varying the strength of this engineered loss, they probe
how interactions shift the so-called “exceptional point” between two dynamical
regimes: the quantum Zeno effect, where strong dissipation freezes dynamics,
and the anti-Zeno effect, where dissipation actually speeds them up. Watching
this crossover unfold in a controllable way is a striking achievement.
    
One of the most surprising findings is what they call “interaction-enhanced
decay.” Here, the presence of strong interactions actually amplifies dissipation
rather than suppressing it. The researchers then flip this effect into a feature:
by exploiting interaction-induced shifts of atomic energy levels, they create a
configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect. In practice, this means that certain spin configurations can be “frozen out” by dissipation, while others are left
untouched.

Although the experiments focus on a small number of atoms, the authors also
develop theory showing how the same mechanism scales up to larger many-body
chains. In those systems, engineered dissipation could act as a kind of “filter,”
removing unwanted spin configurations and leaving behind the ones that are
useful for quantum information or simulation tasks. They describe this process
as dissipative distillation, and it points toward a new approach for preparing
correlated quantum states without relying solely on perfect unitary control.
The larger message of the paper is that dissipation does not have to be
the enemy of quantum technologies. Instead, when engineered and understood
properly, it becomes another knob to turn, one that can simplify quantum state
preparation, stabilize fragile configurations, and even open doors to new dynamical regimes. For Rydberg atom arrays, which already offer strong interactions
and high experimental control, this work establishes a versatile platform for
exploring open quantum many-body systems and for developing new protocols
that blend coherent dynamics with carefully designed loss.
