### Introduction: Quantum Computing Architectures
Quantum computers have diverse architectures and different hardware im-
plementations. Different approaches have their distinct advantages and short-
comings: quantum annealers are good at solving optimization problems, while
digital quantum computers allow us to realize gate-based quantum algorithms.
Different hardware implementations also have unique pros and cons: supercon-
ducting circuits are scalable and offer fast gate operations, while trapped ions
provide high gate fidelity and long-range connectivity.

### Combining Quantum Technologies
A recent paper by Romero et al., 2025 discusses how different quantum com-
puting technologies can be combined to solve a problem more efficiently. They
consider an optimization problem where the solution is given by the ground
state of a higher-order Ising model. On a quantum annealer, this can be ap-
proached by adiabatically evolving a system that is initially in the ground state
of a known Hamiltonian to a system whose ground state encodes the solution
to the optimization problem.

### Counterdiabatic Driving
To accelerate this adiabatic evolution, one can introduce auxiliary counter-
diabatic terms. This process is analogous to walking while holding a full glass
of water: normally, one must walk slowly to avoid spilling, but by moving the
glass in a specific pattern, one can walk faster without spilling. These auxiliary
terms act as the protective hand motion, preventing the system from leaving
the instantaneous ground state even during faster evolution.
Furthermore, the paper introduces BF-DCQO (Bias Field Digitized Coun-
terdiabatic Quantum Optimization), which iteratively performs DCQO by using
the output of the previous step as the input for the next. This iterative approach
improves convergence toward the true ground state while leveraging the benefits
of digitized evolution.

### Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Optimization (DCQO)
Implementing Hamiltonians that include these auxiliary terms is challenging
on a quantum annealer due to non-stoquastic interactions, which are difficult
to realize physically. Therefore, the evolution is digitized, resulting in digitized
counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO).
Romero et al. propose a hybrid strategy: use a D-Wave quantum annealer
to rapidly generate an approximate solution (“fast but not so-high quality”),
and then refine this solution using BF-DCQO on a gate-based superconducting
processor, such as IBM’s devices. This approach leverages the strengths of
both hardware platforms: speed from the annealer and high-fidelity iterative
refinement from digital quantum hardware.

### Implications and Outlook
This work demonstrates a practical way to combine analog and digital quan-
tum computing resources to solve complex optimization problems more effi-
ciently. By integrating counterdiabatic techniques and digitized evolution, the
hybrid approach can achieve better performance than using either platform
alone, opening a path toward more versatile and scalable quantum algorithms.
